# Daily-Schedule

A webpage that allows the user to see the current date/time, and presents the user with different time blocks for the traditional work hours between 9:00am and 5:00pm. The user is able to log/plan all of their to do's for each hour and save those to do's so that when they close the app and re-open it, their to do's will still be there. The hours of the day that have already passed are greyed out, the present hour is red, and the future hours are green.

 # Credits:

 The original source-code for this project, which included some of the HTML file and all of the CSS file,  was created by UCLA extensions bootcamp. Modifications to meet the desired standards of keeping time, updating the time blocks to change color, saving text to local storage and logic to render it back on page once the page is re-loaded, was created by Madilyn Cooper.
